<p>CMfinder is a suite of programs with two main purposes.  CMfinder itself infers an alignment and consensus secondary structure of an RNA, using unaligned sequences as input. RNAphylo, also called pscore, assigns a probabilistic score to an existing alignment, using an explicit phylogenetic model.

CMfinder version 0.3 was written by Zizhen Yao.  Version 0.4 extends the previous version, primarily by gracefully handling the possibility of RNA sequences that are truncated due to the fragmentary nature of metagenomic contigs.  The modifications were done by Zasha Weinberg.</p>

The latest version of CMfinder 0.4 is <a href="cmfinder-0.4.0.35.tgz">here</a> and includes information in the file user-manual.pdf
