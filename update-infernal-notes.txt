was upgrading to infernal-1.1.2.
however, I've decided the diffs	in	cm_pipeline.c and cmsearch.c	are too	complic\
ated, and I should give	up.  I'll keep CMfinder	the way	it is, and not upgrade \
to infernal-1.1.2.  I'll make a	new version of infernal	within motifs_2007 that\
 has just the easy to implement --stop-file and --print-env and	whatever flags,\
 but hopefully has some	good bug fixes.



files that I've changed:

1.1.2-DONE esl_stopwatch.c : minor.  master->elapsed += w->elapsed;

1.1.2-DONE cmbuild.c : ?? /* set to calibrate everything */

1.1.2-DONE cmcalibrate.c

1.1.2-DONE cm_p7_modelmaker.c

>>> cm_pipeline.c

>>> cmsearch.c

1.1.2-DONE infernal.h : #define WITHIN_CMFINDER, cm_p7_Calibrate
