These people have written parts of or otherwise contributed to this software: 

Ivo Hofacker   (all parts)
Peter Stadler  (design, documentation, cluster algorithms)
Walter Fontana (suboptimal folding, pre-historic implementation of mfe folding)
Stefan Wuchty  (suboptimal folding)

Smaller contributions:
Manfred Tacker hacked constrained folding into fold.c for the first time
Sebastian Bonhoeffer's implementation of partition function folding served
	  as a precursor to our part_func.c


Thanks also to everyone who helped testing and finding bugs, especially
Christoph Flamm, Martijn Huynen, ....
